# Custom Simple Forms
Source: https://github.com/mwarger/amplify-auth-examples

This repo was first designed to just be a wrapper over the Cognito-provided forms via Amplify. It originally used the old Ampliy cocde and it had no custom forms, jut the ones that Amplify provide as rendered by their `Authenticator`

It is a simple example, and by no menas any thnig other then using the older Amplidy component called `Authenticator` , not the new UI Component calles `AmplifyAuthenticator`

This was the dev environment at the time.

amplify pull --appId dkticsgt9zcsl --envName dev
