# Custom Simple Forms
Source: https://github.com/mwarger/amplify-auth-examples

This repo was first designed to just be a wrapper over the Cognito provided forms via Amplify. It originally used the old Ampliy cocde and it had no custom forms, jut the ones that Amplify provide as rendered by their `Authenticator`

I intened to re-code the components in to modules, and learn from the ideas. The goal being every Cognio form being a set of custom signin forms, not An Amplify/Cognito Form.
